build triggers:
 - build after other projects are build
 - build periodically
 - poll scm

Jenkins pipeline stage:-
Checkout: Retrieve the source code from the version control system.
Build: Compile and build the project using Maven.
Unit Test: Run unit tests to verify code correctness.
Code Analysis: Perform static code analysis with SonarQube.
Integration Test: Execute integration tests.
Archive Artifacts: Store build artifacts for later use or deployment.
Post-conditions: Send email notifications based on the build result.

for the unit testing have to install the JUnit plugin
you can use the "Publish JUnit test result report" post-build action.

SonarQube:- SonarQube Scanner for Jenkins

Jenkins stages:-

build, deploy, test and release.

How to integrate git with jenkins?

How to integrate maven with jenkins?
  - install maven packages on jenkins server
  - edit the bashrc file with home path variables
  - M2_HOME=/opt/maven
  - M2=/opt/maven/bin
  - JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/<jdk>

Maven Lifecycle:- 
Validate: This step validates if the project structure is correct. For example – It checks if all the dependencies have been downloaded and are available in the local repository.
Compile: It compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class, and stores the classes in the target/classes folder.
Test: It runs unit tests for the project.
Package: This step packages the compiled code in a distributable format like JAR or WAR.
Integration test: It runs the integration tests for the project.
Verify: This step runs checks to verify that the project is valid and meets the quality standards.
Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.
Deploy: It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with other developers.

     schedule the time and select the options like { backup usercontent folder, move older backup to zip file, backup plugins archives }
     
3. How to copy the jenkins job from one container to another one ?
   when you install the jenkins it will create a default dir called .jenkins
   under .jenkins there are some folder like, plugins, jobs, users, war.
   go to jobs folder, there you will find all the jobs.
   before you copy from one server to another server first you need to do SSH connection between the server.
   scp -r <job-name> root@<pub-ip> <dest-dir>
   go to the target jenkins and manage jenkins -> "reload configuration from disk"
   
 4. How to change the default jenkins port ?
    go to the default jenkins file /etc/default/jenkins
    change the port in that file

    $ curl localhost:8090
    go to security port and allow 8090 port
    
 5. what are the steps included in jenkins pipeline?
    build, test, deploy, release
    
 6. what are the post build actions?
    A Jenkins post-build action is a task executed after the build has been completed. 
    Post-build actions are typically used to perform additional processing or reporting on the build results 
    . Sending an email notification with the build results.
    . Archiving build artifacts for future reference.
    . Build artifacts over SSH
    
 7. what is the jenkins version you are using ?

8. how to pass parameters between two jobs?

install parameterized trigger plugin
in job1 at add post build actions trigger parameterized build on other projects.

what are the different ways to trigger jenkins pipeline?
- Poll SCM: Jenkins can periodically check the repository for changes and automatically build if changes are detected. 
              This can be configured in the "Build Triggers" section of a job.
              
- Build Triggers: Jenkins can be configured to use the Git plugin, which allows you to specify a Git repository and branch to build. 
              The plugin can be configured to automatically build when changes are pushed to the repository.
              
- Webhooks: A webhook can be created in GitHub to notify Jenkins when changes are pushed to the repository. 
 Jenkins can then automatically build the updated code. This can be set up in the "Build Triggers" section of a job and in the GitHub repository settings.

what is jenkins shared libraries and how to use that?
  standardization of pipeline, reduce duplication of code, Easy onboarding of new application, projects or teams
  one place to fix issues with the shared or common code.

🔐 Implementing Security in a CI/CD Pipeline
🔹 Key Security Measures in CI/CD
1️⃣ Secure Code and Dependencies
✅ Use Static Code Analysis (SAST) – Scan source code for vulnerabilities before building.
Tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify

2️⃣ Secure Build Process
✅ Use Isolated Build Environments – Run builds in sandboxed environments to prevent contamination.
✅ Least Privilege Principle – Use minimal permissions for Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab Runners.
✅ Scan for Secrets & Credentials – Ensure no hardcoded secrets in code.

Tools: TruffleHog, Git-Secrets, Gitleaks

3️⃣ Secure Containerization
✅ Use Image Scanning (SCA - Software Composition Analysis) – Check for vulnerabilities in Docker images.

Tools: Anchore, Clair, Aqua Security
✅ Implement Least Privilege for Containers – Avoid running as root.
✅ Use Signed & Trusted Images – Pull only verified images from repositories.
✅ Restrict Unnecessary Ports & Permissions – Follow minimal exposure policy.

4️⃣ Secure Secrets Management
✅ Never Hardcode Secrets – Use secret management tools instead.

Tools: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets
✅ Environment Variables Instead of Config Files – Store credentials securely.
✅ Encrypt Secrets in Transit & Storage – Use TLS/SSL & encryption mechanisms.


5️⃣ Secure Deployment & Runtime Security
✅ Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Restrict who can deploy & manage CI/CD pipelines.
✅ Enable Network Security Controls – Use firewalls & security groups for microservices.
✅ Monitor & Audit Logs – Track changes, access, and unusual activities.

Tools: ELK Stack, Splunk, Datadog

🌿 Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline – Explained
📌 What is a Multibranch Pipeline?
A Multibranch Pipeline in Jenkins is an automated CI/CD process that dynamically discovers, manages, 
and executes pipelines for each branch in a repository.
🚀 Why use it?
Automatically detects new branches and creates pipelines for them.
Supports different configurations for each branch.
Reduces the need for separate pipeline jobs for each branch.
Useful for feature branches, hotfixes, and release branches.

🛠️ Steps to Create a Multibranch Pipeline
1️⃣ Install Necessary Plugins
Ensure you have the "Pipeline" and "Multibranch Pipeline" plugins installed.

2️⃣ Create a Multibranch Pipeline Job
1️⃣ Open Jenkins Dashboard → Click on New Item
2️⃣ Enter a name (e.g., My-Multibranch-Pipeline).
3️⃣ Select Multibranch Pipeline → Click OK.

3️⃣ Configure Repository Details
1️⃣ Under Branch Source, select Git or GitHub (or Bitbucket, GitLab).
2️⃣ Enter your repository URL.
3️⃣ Add credentials (if required).
4️⃣ Click on Discover Branches to auto-detect all branches.

4️⃣ Define the Jenkinsfile
Jenkins uses a Jenkinsfile (Declarative or Scripted pipeline) to define the pipeline for each branch.

5️⃣Save & Build
 Click Save, then Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now.
 Jenkins will auto-detect branches and create jobs for them.

Jenkins Stages:-

Checkout (Fetch latest source code from GitHub/GitLab)
Build (Compile Java code using Maven/Gradle.)
Test (Run unit/integration tests.)
Code Analysis (Analyze code quality using SonarQube.)
Build & Push Image (Create Docker image & push to registry)
Deployment (Deploy app to Tomcat, Kubernetes, or cloud)

Potential Issues When Building a Java Package Using Maven in a CI/CD Pipeline
1️⃣ Dependency Resolution Issues
❌ Problem:
Maven may fail to resolve dependencies due to missing JARs, incorrect repository configurations, or network issues.

You might see errors like:
Could not resolve dependencies for project com.example:app:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT

🔍 Why It Happens:
The required dependencies are not available in the central repository or corporate Nexus/Artifactory.
The internet connection is unstable, causing failures in downloading dependencies.
Dependencies have transitive conflicts, leading to version mismatches.
✅ Solution:
Check pom.xml for missing or incorrect dependencies.
Use mvn dependency:tree to identify conflicts.
Use mvn dependency:purge-local-repository to force a fresh dependency download.
If using a private repository, ensure .m2/settings.xml has the correct Maven repository URL.

2️⃣ Build Fails Due to Java Version Mismatch
❌ Problem:
The pipeline fails with an error like:
Unsupported class file major version 61

🔍 Why It Happens:
The Maven compiler plugin (maven-compiler-plugin) is using a different Java version than what is installed in the 
CI/CD agent. The local system runs Java 11, but the CI/CD server runs Java 8, causing compatibility issues.
✅ Solution:
Check and set the Java version in pom.xml
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>

3️⃣Out of Memory (OOM) Errors
❌ Problem:

The pipeline crashes due to out-of-memory (OOM) errors
Java heap space
🔍 Why It Happens:
JVM memory limits are too low for the build process.
The build machine has insufficient RAM.
Maven plugins consume too much memory (e.g., maven-surefire-plugin in tests).
✅ Solution:
Increase memory limits
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"

If using Docker, allocate more resources:
docker run -m 2G my-maven-build

5️⃣ Missing or Incorrect settings.xml Configuration
❌ Problem:
The pipeline fails because Maven cannot authenticate with a private repository:
401 Unauthorized - Access to the repository denied

🔍 Why It Happens:
~/.m2/settings.xml is missing or incorrectly configured.
Authentication credentials for private repositories (Nexus, Artifactory, AWS CodeArtifact) are not provided.
✅ Solution:
Verify settings.xml includes correct credentials
<servers>
  <server>
    <id>private-repo</id>
    <username>your-username</username>
    <password>your-password</password>
  </server>
</servers>

Use environment variables instead of hardcoding passwords:
<password>${env.REPO_PASSWORD}</password>

6️⃣ Artifacts Not Uploaded to the Repository
❌ Problem:
The build succeeds, but the final JAR/WAR file is not uploaded to Nexus/Artifactory.
🔍 Why It Happens:
The mvn deploy step is missing.
The repository settings in pom.xml are incorrect.
✅ Solution:
Ensure distributionManagement is correctly configured in pom.xml
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>nexus</id>
        <url>https://nexus.example.com/repository/maven-releases/</url>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>

Run the deploy command:
mvn clean deploy

what is the difference between mvn clean package and mvn clean install??

1️⃣ mvn clean package 
Removes the old build files (clean).
Compiles the Java code.
Runs unit tests.
Packages the application into a JAR/WAR file.
The JAR/WAR is stored in the target/ folder inside the project.
📌 Who Can Use It?
Only you can use it because it’s inside your project folder.
Other projects cannot use it.

2️⃣ mvn clean install
Does everything that mvn clean package does plus:
Copies the JAR/WAR to your local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository).
📌 Who Can Use It?
Now, other Maven projects on your computer can use this JAR/WAR as a dependency.

Example Scenario
🎯 Scenario 1: You only need the package
You are deploying a standalone app, and you only need the JAR/WAR file.
👉 Run:
mvn clean package
✅ The JAR/WAR is available only in target/.

🎯 Scenario 2: You want other projects to use this package
You are working on Project A, and another Project B needs this JAR/WAR.
👉 Run:
mvn clean install
✅ The JAR/WAR is now in ~/.m2/repository, so Project B can use it.

3️⃣ mvn clean deploy (Remote Sharing)
Does everything install does
Uploads the built JAR/WAR to a remote repository (like Nexus, Artifactory, Maven Central)
📍 Where is the JAR stored? → Remote Maven repo (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory)
📍 Who can use it? → Other developers, CI/CD pipelines, production systems
✅ Use Case:
When you want other teams/projects to use your JAR/WAR.
In CI/CD pipelines, when your artifact needs to be stored centrally.
