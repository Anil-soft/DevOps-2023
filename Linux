Linux
1. Linux is reliable, security and open source.
2. Linux is hardware independent and there are several types of linux os.
they are:-
centos, ubuntu, mint, kali, fedora, suse.
3. kernel is key component of OS.
4. we have to pass the instructions to the kernel via shell.
5. Based on the requirement of the user, kernel does start communicating with the hardware.
6. kernel acts heart of the OS. without kernel can not run the server.

* Filesystem hierarchy:-
1. (/) we call it like parent root, if parent gets deleted, entire OS will be deleted.
2. /root is defferent than /.

* Folders:- 
1. Bin & user:- binaries will be stored.
2. Home:- users home directories will be stored.
3. Var:- system logs will be stored.
4. etc:- system configurations will be stored.
5. opt:- optional things will be stored.
6. temp:- temporary data can keep it under temp folder.

Linux interview questions and answers

Q- How will you change the default user id value in Linux?
     vi /etc/login.defs in this file we can configure range of id value
Usermod -u 1006 username

Q- /etc/hosts (Which RPM is responsible for creating this file).

Q- What is the difference between RPM and YUM?
    RPM is redhat packet manager and YUM is yellowdog updater modified both command are used for manage software
RPM --> RPM will not resolve the dependencies 
YUM --> yum will resolve the dependencies

Q- What is the difference between Hard and Soft Link?
ln /tmp/test   /etc/anil -> to create the hard link  (since the i node value is same data will not be lost)
ln -s  /tmp/test   /etc/kumar  --> once the main file is removed there is no value for soft link 

inode:- (index node) Inodes stores metadata about the file it refers to. This metadata contains all the information about the said file.
        size, permission, owner/group, location of the hard drive, date/time.

Q- rm -rf /tmp/test gives error operation not permitted. Reason?
   chttar is applied on the file, so that it can't be deleted
   chattr -i /tmp/test  -> to remove the chattr
   chattr +i /tmp/test  -> to apply the chattr

Q- What is a sticky bit?
only owner of the file or root can delete the file. Sticky bit is implemented on directories not on files

Q- How will you check open ports on Linux Server?
Netstat -tulpn

Q- How will you check open ports on remote servers (without login)
Install the package first yum install nmap -y
nmap -A <ipaddr of the server>

Q- your site is throwing 500 error, how will you start troubleshooting?

Q- how to check ip address of the host?
ifconfig, hostname -I

Q- how to find files created by a user?
find /some/path -user username -ls

Q- what is ulimit?
ulimit is nothing but how many files users can open
$lsof  -> to check open files in the OS

Q- take backup of logs files on backup servers

Q- How will you find out which service is running on which port? if multiple JAVA process are running how will you indentify specific process?

All the performed events will be logged into --> /var/log/messages
more /var/log/messages --> to see the logs one by one

  top:- 
How long it is running, users, load average, how many processors are running, sleeping, stopped, CPU utilization, memory consumption.
PR represents priority number, NI represents nice value, VIRT virtual memory, RES reserved memory, SHR shared memory, S state of the process. 
Shift p --> top CPU consuming processors
Shift m --> to memory consuming processors 

What is swap space?
Swap space is like a 2nd memory and it will not be in memory chip card, it will be in disk.
Use case of swap space?
All the inactive processors will be dump into the swap space. 

ifcfg-eth0 --> to configure the network details



What is zombie process?
If we are killing the parent process, child processors, which are coming from the parent will be thinking that parent is alive. Childs will be continuously working and simply consuming the memory. The more zombie process we have the more performance issues we will get.

What is the difference between standard partition & logical volume?
In standard partition we cannot create the file size dynamically, first we have to take backup of the file and delete the original file, and take required volume size and attach back up file.

Logical volume we can increase the size dynamically. We can take the disks and all together we can create the volume group.

Q- user is not able to ssh into remote server, what could be the reasons?
   1. 400 reason might not be assigned to pem key
   2. there is a file /etc/ssh/sshd_config, in this file you have to check whether SSH port is assigned correctly or not and it listening on IPV6 or not
   3. particular user has root permit or not, sometimes there could be entry like (DenyUser Anil) shold have (AllowUser Anil)
   4. Have to check the entry (PubkeyAuthentication yes) is there or not.
   5. sshd folder should have appropriate permission like 700

Q- user root has created a file (/tmp/abc) with 700 permission, Anil should have full access to file, how will you do this?
   $ setfacl -m u:lokendra:rwx /tmp/abc

Q- How will you change the default login shell for all upcoming users on Linux?
   - got to the file called /etc/default/useradd there you will find entry called SHELL=/bin/bash

Q- how to disable root account
   - $ usermod -s /sbin/nologin root
   - $ usermod -s /bin/bash root  -> to enable root account

Q- I want to restart the service only if the service is running, if service is in a stopped state the command should do nothing
   - $ systemctl try-restart httpd.service

Q- what is max filename length allowed in linux?
   255

Q- what is drop cache in linux and how do you clear it?
   Files that were recently accessed are stored here so they will not need to be queried from the hard disk again, 
   unless that file changes or the cache is cleared to make room for other data. 
   This puts less read and write impact on a hard drive and increases speed since files can be read from RAM much faster.
   $ echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches # clear PageCache
   $ echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches # clear dentries and inodes
   $ echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches # clear dentries and inodes
