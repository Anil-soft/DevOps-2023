<== Ansible installation ==>
  - sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2
  - add the private key (vi ec2-key.pem) assign chmod 400 ec2-key.pem permission
  - ssh-agent bash
  - cp ec2-key.pem ~/.ssh/
    - ssh-add ~/.ssh/ec2-key.pem 
  - create the inventory file and add the private ips
  - default location /etc/ansible/hosts
  
 :- Ansible works on client only model which means no need to have master server
 
 :- if we want define variables for the particulary server we have create the dir called hosts_vars and variable file should be same as server name
 
 :- to define variables for the set of group of servers have to create the dir called group_Vars
 
 :- ansible -m setup -a "filter=ansible_distribution" server1 => to print the server information
 
 :- ansible-playbook dev.yaml -e my_name=anil => to pass the variable from command line
 
 Note:- ansible.cfg file the important file in ansible which is having all the information like inventory, interpreter, private key file, privilege escalation
 
 Idempotency:- if the configuration is already existed then it will skip or else it will execute the configation

do you think ansible is better than other configuration management tool ? if yes, why?
 - Ansible is agent lesst, if we configure hundreds of virtual machines, to configure all of the these servers no need to install
   any agent on the servers. you can make communication between the servers through SSH.
 - Ansible uses yaml scripting which very easy to use.

What is dyamic inventory?
 - 
 
what is ansible galaxy and how to use it?
 - ansible galaxy is used to create the roles 
  $ ansible-galaxy install namespace.role_name
  
what are handlers in ansible and  why are they used ?
 - Sometimes you want a task to run only when a change is made on a machine.
 -  For example, you may want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service, but not if the configuration is unchanged. 
 -  Ansible uses handlers to address this use case. Handlers are tasks that only run when notified.
Example:- 
 - name: Write the apache config file
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: /srv/httpd.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd.conf
      notify:
      - Restart apache
handlers:
    - name: Restart apache
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
        
How to executes ansible tasks in paralell ?
  - 
  
Explain about ansible tags ?
 - If you have a large playbook, it becomes useful to be able to run only a specific part of it rather than running everything in the playbook. 
 
- hosts: webservers
  become: True
  tasks:
    - name: install packages
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      tags:
        - install
    - name: start apache server
      service:
         name: httpd
         state: started
         enable: True
      tags:
        - start
    - name: deploy static website
      copy:
        src: index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/
      tags:
        - deploy
        
    ansible-playbook apache.yaml --tags=install,start
    ansible-playbook apache.yaml --skip-tags=install
     
Interview questions and answers?
1. what is configuration management?
   configuration management is nothing but managing servers like installation of packages, upgrades on softwares,

2. what is ansible tower?
   ansible tower is like enterprise level, it provides some graphical user interface and extends the ansible capabilities.

3. can you explain me structure of ansible playbook using roles?

  - defaults :- default variables for the role
  - Files:- Contains files to copy to destination
  - Handlers:- Based on notify do something specified
  - Meta:- meta data about current role ( like what is the ansible version, who is the author )
  - Tasks:- List of task that to be executed
  - Templates:- Template files to deploy
  - test:- if you want additional verification of your build
  - vars:- other variables for the role

  - name: example ansible playbook for roles
    hosts: all
    become: yes
    roles:
      - custom-role
- import_tasks: packages.yml  { to import the tasks into main.yml }

4. does ansible support parallel execution of tasks ?


5. can you place the ansible vars precedence ?
   extra vars we define in the command line (-e "user=my_user"), set_facts, include vars, task vars, role vars, group vars.

6.what do you think ansible can improve ?
  ansible can not provide verbosity in the task basis, so it can improve in that aspect.

7. what are facts in ansible ?
   facts are nothing but they have the details about hosts or VMs which we have mentioned in the inventory
   it can be installed operating system, IP address, OS family.

Explain scenario when to use either ansible playbooks or AD HOC commands?
  playbooks:
    Playbooks are reusable. If you find yourself repeating tasks across different scenarios, playbooks allow you 
    to encapsulate and reuse configurations, making your infrastructure code more modular and maintainable.
    Playbooks can utilize roles, which are a way of organizing tasks, handlers, and variables into reusable structures. 
    Playbooks use a declarative syntax, allowing you to express the desired state of your system. This makes it easier to understand 

  AD HOC:
    Use ad hoc commands for one-time commands or simple tasks that don't require a full playbook. 
    $ ansible web_servers -i inventory.ini -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present"
    Ad hoc commands are useful for running quick checks, gathering information, or troubleshooting issues on remote systems.
    $ ansible all -i inventory.ini -m shell -a "free -m"

 what are the various ways to verify playbooks, prior to execution?
   --syntax-check check the syntax
   --check  how the execution will happen show the preview
