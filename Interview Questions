What is jenkins remote access API?
  - install the plugin called "Build authorization token trigger"
  - on jenkins at the build triggers enable the option "build this job remotely"
  - demo url "http://localhost:8080/view/CodeBook/job/Job1/build?token=12345"
  
what are the uses of parameters and how to do build parameterized ?
  - A build parameter allows us to pass data into our Jenkins jobs.
  - Using build parameters, we can pass any data we want: git branch name, secret credentials, hostnames and ports, and so on.
  - Any Jenkins job or pipeline can be parameterized. All we need to do is check the box on the General settings tab, “This project is parameterized”.
  Types of parameters:- Boolean parameter, choice parameter, credentials parameter, file parameter, Git parameter.
  
 what are the environment variables in jenkins?
  - Environment variables are predetermined values, Environment variables are global key-value pairs Jenkins can access and inject into a project. 
  - Use Jenkins environment variables to avoid having to code the same values for each project
  
what is git cherry pick command ?
  - Cherry-picking in Git stands for applying some commit from one branch into another branch.
  - In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. 
  - You can revert the commit and apply it on another branch.
  - Git cherry-pick is helpful to apply the changes that are accidentally made in the wrong branch. 
  - To make all the changes of the new branch into the master branch, we will use the git pull, but for this particular commit, we will use git cherry-pick command. 
  - $  git cherry-pick <commit id>  
  
How to check the git commit id's ?
  $ git log
  
what is bare metal?
 - Bare metal is a computer system without a base operating system (OS) or installed applications.
 
what is Hypervisor ?
  - A hypervisor is a form of virtualization software used in Cloud hosting to divide and allocate the resources on various pieces of hardware.
  - The program which provides partitioning, isolation, or abstraction is called a virtualization hypervisor.
  - The hypervisor is a hardware virtualization technique that allows multiple guest operating systems (OS) to run on a single host system at the same time.
  - The hypervisor runs directly on the underlying host system. 
  
what is the difference between docker and virtual machine ?
 - virtual machine:- 
     - infrastructure -> Host OS -> Hypervisor -> Guest OS on top of this application will be istalled.
     - Allows multiple virtual machines and applications to run on the same physical machine.
     - Host OS can be different from guest OS.
     
 - Docker:- 
     - infrastructure -> Host OS -> Docker daemon -> application
     - The OS is abstracted via containers rather than the hardware. 
     - With the use of containers, a developer can package up a program with all of its constituent elements, 
       including libraries and other dependencies, and deliver it as a single package. 
       
 what is git runner ?
   - GitHub offers hosted virtual machines to run workflows.
   - The virtual machine contains an environment of tools, packages, and settings available for GitHub Actions to use.
   - For example, a runner can clone your repository locally, install testing software, and then run commands that evaluate your code.
   - GitHub provides runners that you can use to run your jobs, or you can host your own runners.
   - Each GitHub-hosted runner is a new virtual machine (VM) hosted by GitHub with the runner application,
     and other tools preinstalled, and is available with Ubuntu Linux, Windows, or macOS operating systems.
   - When the job begins, GitHub automatically provisions a new VM for that job. All steps in the job execute on the VM, 
     allowing the steps in that job to share information using the runner's filesystem.
     
 What is S3 bucket versioning and how can you demonstrate this ?
   :- click on the bucket -> properties -> bucket versioning enable -> enable versioning
   :- Suppose you have hosted static website with the image, after that you have added new image then the old image is not going to replace
      it is just going to create the new version of an object
   :- once you hide versions and delete the image, i won't going to be deleted it's just going to mark as delete marker, and image will not be available.
   :- once you show the versions, it will show delete marker and image versions will be available
   :- if you want rollback to previous versions, you can click on show versions and delete the latest version.
 2nd interview
 
  1. Explain about S3 lifecycle and how can you move from one storage class to another?
     - click on the bucket - management -> create lifecycle rule -> select the option ( This rule applies to all objects in the bucket )
     - To filter a rule by object size, you can check Specify minimum object size, Specify maximum object size, or both options
     - Under Lifecycle rule actions, choose the actions that you want your lifecycle rule to perform:
        Transition current versions of objects between storage classes
        Transition previous versions of objects between storage classes
        Expire current versions of objects 
         - This configuration allows users to automatically expire the current version of the Amazon S3 objects stored 
           within the bucket after a specified number of days
         - for version eabled buckets, amazon s3 adds a delete marker as current version of an object will be retained as previous version.
           for non current version S3 will premanently removes the object. 
       Permanently delete previous versions of objects
       Storage classes
        Standard-IA
        Intelligent-Tiering
        One Zone-IA
        S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
        Glacier Deep Archive
        Add transition to and select the storage class and Days after object creation, enter the number of days after creation to transition the object
        
  2. How can you access the S3 bucket within the VPC?
  
  3. we have multiple users only one person can access to S3 bucket, how can you do that?
  
  4. explin about what is the difference between NAT GW and Internet GW and how can you configure them?
     If any private server wants to communicate with the internet, then we have to create NAT gateway have to communicate
     with the internet through NAT gateway.
     create NAT gateway on public subnet and allocate the elastic IP. in in routing table, click routers and add that NGW
     
     we can create an internet gateway and attach it to the VPC and in routing table, click routers and add that IGW.
     Internet is used to comminate with the network for public servers.

  11. what are the DNS records ?
       A – maps a hostname to IPv4
       AAAA – maps a hostname to IPv6
       CNAME – maps a hostname to another hostname
       
  12. what is the difference between ALB and NLB?
      <== Application Load Balancer ==>
    • Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP)
    • Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines 
      (target groups)
    • Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
    • Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
    • ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application 
      (example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
    • ALB can route to multiple target groups
    • Health checks are at the target group level
    
 <= Network Load Balancer ==>
    • Network load balancers (Layer 4)
    • Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
    • Handle millions of request per seconds
    • NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
    
  13. what could be the reasons of not able to SSH into EC2 instance?
  
  14. I have one server on production env, i have lost the pem.key so how can i login to that instance?
      take the snapshot of the EBS volume, and create volume through snapshot and take snapshot of the AMI,
      whille creating new instance, creat through AMI that we took snapshot from existing VM and attach volume the new instance.
      
  15. what are the difference ways to login to instance apart from SSH?
  16. which file will be having all the user information ?
       /etc/passwd ( usernames, encrypted passwords, user id, users group id, the /home directory of the user, users login shell )
       
  17. which file you need to check that how may users have access to the servers?
  18. what proc dir will be containing?
  19. am on the the root user and i need to do some tasks with the particular user, how can i do that?

  21. you have written terraform script to provision s3 bucket and ec2 instance and subnets, i need to create only ec2 instance how can i do that?
  22. explain about META arguements in terraform?
  23. you have provision the 5 instance and only 1 instance i need to destroy how can i do that?
  24. How can you attach role to the existin ec2 instance.
  25. you have written code for the ec2 instance in different file and how can you define that in main.tf file?
  26. How can you store the secrets in terraform?
  27. There is a file only you can modify that file linux, how can you do that?
