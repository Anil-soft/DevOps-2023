what are the uses of parameters and how to do build parameterized ?
  - A build parameter allows us to pass data into our Jenkins jobs.
  - Using build parameters, we can pass any data we want: git branch name, secret credentials, hostnames and ports, and so on.
  - Any Jenkins job or pipeline can be parameterized. All we need to do is check the box on the General settings tab, “This project is parameterized”.
  Types of parameters:- Boolean parameter, choice parameter, credentials parameter, file parameter, Git parameter.
  
 what are the environment variables in jenkins?
  - Environment variables are predetermined values, Environment variables are global key-value pairs Jenkins can access and inject into a project. 
  - Use Jenkins environment variables to avoid having to code the same values for each project
