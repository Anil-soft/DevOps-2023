What is jenkins remote access API?
  - install the plugin called "Build authorization token trigger"
  - on jenkins at the build triggers enable the option "build this job remotely"
  - demo url "http://localhost:8080/view/CodeBook/job/Job1/build?token=12345"
  
what are the uses of parameters and how to do build parameterized ?
  - A build parameter allows us to pass data into our Jenkins jobs.
  - Using build parameters, we can pass any data we want: git branch name, secret credentials, hostnames and ports, and so on.
  - Any Jenkins job or pipeline can be parameterized. All we need to do is check the box on the General settings tab, “This project is parameterized”.
  Types of parameters:- Boolean parameter, choice parameter, credentials parameter, file parameter, Git parameter.
  
 what are the environment variables in jenkins?
  - Environment variables are predetermined values, Environment variables are global key-value pairs Jenkins can access and inject into a project. 
  - Use Jenkins environment variables to avoid having to code the same values for each project
  
what is git cherry pick command ?
  - Cherry-picking in Git stands for applying some commit from one branch into another branch.
  - In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. 
  - You can revert the commit and apply it on another branch.
  - Git cherry-pick is helpful to apply the changes that are accidentally made in the wrong branch. 
  - To make all the changes of the new branch into the master branch, we will use the git pull, but for this particular commit, we will use git cherry-pick command. 
  - $  git cherry-pick <commit id>  
  
How to check the git commit id's ?
  $ git log
  
what is bare metal?
 - Bare metal is a computer system without a base operating system (OS) or installed applications.
 
what is Hypervisor ?
  - A hypervisor is a form of virtualization software used in Cloud hosting to divide and allocate the resources on various pieces of hardware.
  - The program which provides partitioning, isolation, or abstraction is called a virtualization hypervisor.
  - The hypervisor is a hardware virtualization technique that allows multiple guest operating systems (OS) to run on a single host system at the same time.
  - The hypervisor runs directly on the underlying host system. 
  
what is the difference between docker and virtual machine ?
 - virtual machine:- 
     - infrastructure -> Host OS -> Hypervisor -> Guest OS on top of this application will be istalled.
     - Allows multiple virtual machines and applications to run on the same physical machine.
     - Host OS can be different from guest OS.
     
 - Docker:- 
     - infrastructure -> Host OS -> Docker daemon -> application
     - The OS is abstracted via containers rather than the hardware. 
     - With the use of containers, a developer can package up a program with all of its constituent elements, 
       including libraries and other dependencies, and deliver it as a single package. 
       
 what is git runner ?
   - GitHub offers hosted virtual machines to run workflows.
   - The virtual machine contains an environment of tools, packages, and settings available for GitHub Actions to use.
   - For example, a runner can clone your repository locally, install testing software, and then run commands that evaluate your code.
   - GitHub provides runners that you can use to run your jobs, or you can host your own runners.
   - Each GitHub-hosted runner is a new virtual machine (VM) hosted by GitHub with the runner application,
     and other tools preinstalled, and is available with Ubuntu Linux, Windows, or macOS operating systems.
   - When the job begins, GitHub automatically provisions a new VM for that job. All steps in the job execute on the VM, 
     allowing the steps in that job to share information using the runner's filesystem.
