Can you explain head in terms of git ?
  - A head is nothing but a reference to the last commit object of a branch.
  - To go or checkout to 1 commit before the latest commit, we use git checkout HEAD~1
  - To uncommit the last 3 commits without losing the changes, we first run git
    reset HEAD~3 . Then we can see the changes made in the last 3 commits and then
    update it manually and commit it finally.

    HEAD~3

  - HEAD~1:- refer to the first commit
  - HEAD~2:- refer to the second commit
  - git difftool HEAD~1 HEAD~2 => to see the difference between 1st and 2nd commit
