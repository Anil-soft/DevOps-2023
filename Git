Can you explain head in terms of git ?
  - A head is nothing but a reference to the last commit object of a branch.
  - To go or checkout to 1 commit before the latest commit, we use git checkout HEAD~1
  - To uncommit the last 3 commits without losing the changes, we first run git
    reset HEAD~3 . Then we can see the changes made in the last 3 commits and then
    update it manually and commit it finally.
  - In order to uncommit the last 3 commits and also remove the changes, we can
    run the command: git reset --hard HEAD~3 . This command will completely
    remove all the changes
  - To look into the changes made in the last 3 commits, we can run git diff
    HEAD~3
  - HEAD:- refer to the latest commit
  - HEAD~1:- refer to the first commit
  - HEAD~2:- refer to the second commit
  $ git difftool HEAD~1 HEAD~2 => to see the difference between 1st and 2nd commit
  $ git log { to list all the commits }
  $ git checkout HEAD~1
  $ git reset HEAD~3
  $ git reset --hard HEAD~3
  $ git diff HEAD~3
  
what is git conflict and how to resolve ?
  - When two branches are trying to merge, and both are edited at the same time and in the same file, 
    Git won't be able to identify which version is to take for changes. Such a situation is called merge conflict. 
  - git can not resolve conflicts automatically, we need to discuss with the fellow developer and find out the which
    changes are required and delete the which are not required.
  $ git mergetool
  
What does git status command do?
 - The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
 - It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.
 $ git status
 
what is git index ?
  - The Git index is a staging area between the working directory and repository. It is used to build up a set of changes that you want to commit together. 
    untracked => staged => committed => modified
    
What does git add command do?
  - This command adds files and changes to the index of the existing directory
  $ git add .
  $ git add <file_name>
  
what does git commit do ?
  The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.
  $ git commit -m " commit message "
  
explain about git stash ?
  - git stash will save the untracked files on the temporary env
  $ git stash
  $ git stash list
  $ git pop {The stash pop command in git will take the content from the stash file and then apply those changes to our current working file}
  $ git stash apply
  
what is the difference between git pull and git fetch ?
  git fetch - only downloads latest changes into the local repo. it downloads fresh changes that other developers have pushed to the remote repo.
              it does not merge latest changes to your working dir.
  git pull - git fetch + git merge
  
how to squash multiple commits into one commit ?
  $ git rebase -i HEAD~3 { three commits will be merged into one }
  
what is the difference between git merge vs git rebase ?
  - The first thing to understand about git rebase is that it solves the same problem as git merge. 
    Both of these commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branch
    
  git merge - Git merge safeguards the histories of both the repositories.
    Consider a condition where you have to work regularly on the main branch and have a very active main branch, 
    in such conditions the commit history will become messy, thus resulting in a painful experience for the developers to understand the log or the commit history.
    
  git rebase - The major benefit of using git rebase is it provides a cleaner merge history. It works linearly, 
               removing the unnecessary merge commits, unlike git merge. 
    
  $ git checkout feature
  $ git merge main
  $ git rebase main
  
what is git tag ?
  - Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository’s history as being important.
  - Typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on).
  - Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message;
  - It’s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this information;
  - if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don’t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.
  
  $ git tag v1.0
  $ git tag { to list out the tags }
  $ git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
  $ git push origin v1.5
  $ git push origin --tags
  $ git tag -d v1.4-lw

$git diff HEAD^ HEAD  ->This command compares the last two commits
$ git diff commit1 commit2
